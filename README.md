# Analytical-Mechanics-Double-Pendulum-Simulation
This project is the final work of Analytical Mechanics Course taken in 2018 at Zewailcity. The project was to derive the equation of motion of double pendulum from first principles and to write a code to numerically, solve the equations and simulate the motion with different initial conditions
